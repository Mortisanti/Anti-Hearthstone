Kripparrian VODs Before Hearthstone Took Over

This repository contains a crude HTML file that, once downloaded or copied/saved, can be opened in a browser of your choice. Or you can just follow this link: https://mortisanti.github.io/Anti-Hearthstone/

The file/page contains links to nearly every VOD (Video On Demand) that's available on https://www.twitch.tv/nl_kripp/videos, prior to Kripparrian's Hearthstone streaming phase. It includes streams from when he played and streamed Neverwinter, Guild Wars, World of Warcraft, Final Fantasy, Path of Exile, and most notably, Diablo.

If it's missing any links to pre-Hearthstone VODs, feel free to let me know in the "Issues" section.

Enjoy.
